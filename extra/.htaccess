## You should disable Indexes and MultiViews either here or in the
## global config. Symlinks maybe needed for URL rewriting.
Options -Indexes -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks
#
## Make sure nobody gets the htaccess files:
<Files ~ "^[\._]ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Satisfy All
</Files>
# We rewrite the URL, so the old URLs are located correctly:
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^wiki/(.*)              blog/$1  [QSA,L]
