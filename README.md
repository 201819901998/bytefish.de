# http://bytefish.de #

[http://bytefish.de](http://bytefish.de) currently runs on a [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org) installation, which will be replaced with a generator for static pages. I love [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org), but I don't have much time for possibly keeping it in sync with the latest security fixes. 

Since I am much too lazy to come up with something own, I am currently testing:

* [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com)
* [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

I think I'll build the page upon [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), because I am much more familiar with [Python](http://python.org). Any hints or suggestions are welcome.
