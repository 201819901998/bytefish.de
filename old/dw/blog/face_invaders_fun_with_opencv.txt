====== face invaders: fun with opencv ======
{{:blog:shot0005.png?150 |Augmented Space Invaders}}

This was a one day project by [[http://m4dm4x.zdenkavajsova.cz/|Filip]].

[[http://m4dm4x.zdenkavajsova.cz/|Filip]] hacked a nice version of Space Invaders with OpenCV called: //Face Invaders//. The gameplay is a little different but see yourself: [[http://www.inf.hs-zigr.de/~safimart/si_1.avi|http://www.inf.hs-zigr.de/~safimart/si_1.avi]]. Your ship fires when your nose goes above the line. 

Filip has put the code on his github account at: https://github.com/m4dm4x/FaceInvaders.
