====== face recognition in videos with opencv ======

Writing the documentation for the new OpenCV cv::FaceRecognizer class (which is libfacerec) made me realize again, how cool the OpenCV2 C++ API is. You could write an application for face recognition in videos within what... 50 lines of code? 

Expect very, very cool examples for the cv::FaceRecognizer documentation. Sneak preview, because it's such an awesome one.
