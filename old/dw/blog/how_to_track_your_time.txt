====== how to track your time ======
{{ :blog:pymetracker-bar-0.2.0.png?200|}}

You always wanted to track the time you spend on your tasks? You've already got the strength to organize yourself into discrete units, but you are unable to find a tool for tracking your time?

[[http://www.kakaomilchkuh.de|Robert]] has created a nice little tool called [[https://www.kakaomilchkuh.de/pymetracker/|pymetracker]] to eliminate your problems. Adding, timing and switching between tasks is intuitive. [[https://www.kakaomilchkuh.de/pymetracker/|pymetracker]] comes with a nice user interface and a traybar icon (because everybody loves tray icons, at least I do).
