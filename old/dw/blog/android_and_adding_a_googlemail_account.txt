====== android and adding a googlemail account ======
This is just a short one. Yesterday I accidentally deleted a Googlemail account from my Android phone. No problem? Ha! Whenever I tried to add the account through
''Accounts & sync -> Add account'' Android was throwing a "Can't establish a reliable data connection to the server [...]" back at me.

Now what's really weird is the solution that works for me: You can add your account by logging in to the Youtube app with your Googlemail credentials.
