====== introducing libfacerec ======

I've started working on a face recognition library for the OpenCV C++ API: [[https://github.com/bytefish/libfacerec|libfacerec]]. 

The library is header-only and has no additional dependencies, so using it is as simple as adding it to your include path. The Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces methods have already been implemented and most parts of the library have been tested (finally!). A LBP-based face recognition is planned & almost completed, I just have to finish writing the tests for it.

Please consider the library as **Work In Progress**, there are probably some interface changes coming.
