====== math in the web ======

I am working on a project where mathematical expressions have to be authored and exported into different formats. Representing mathematical expressions in LaTeX seems to be a good choice, because it's kind of a standard in the world of mathematics.

There are two cool projects to handle expressions in LaTeX:
   * http://gva.noekeon.org/blahtexml/ (C++) Transform LaTeX -> MathML, PNG, ...
   * http://www.mathjax.org/ (JavaScript) Transform LaTeX -> MathML, PNG, ...

===== online latex editor =====

[[http://www.bytefish.de/editor|Here]] is a demonstration of what can be done with MathJax. It's an online LaTeX editor [[http://m4dm4x.zdenkavajsova.cz|Filip]] and I hacked yesterday. The code may be strange, because we are no JavaScript programmers. The design took some "inspiration" from http://suim.jp (a cool online latex editor).

You will need JavaScript and [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_MathML_Project/Fonts|MathML Fonts]] for the demo.

==== Demo ====
You can find the demo at: http://www.bytefish.de/editor.

==== Screenshots ====

| {{:blog:edit2.png?200|}} | Expressions can be written in LaTeX, clicked from the toolbar or drag and dropped into the input area. |
| {{:blog:edit3.png?200|}} | Invalid expressions render the input box border red. The last valid expression is still in the output area. |
