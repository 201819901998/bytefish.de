====== libfacerec update ======

I have just released version 0.02 of libfacerec, which is now available at http://www.github.com/bytefish/libfacerec. libfacerec is a modern face recognition library for the OpenCV C++ API and comes with:

  * Eigenfaces as described in: Turk, M., and Pentland, A. "Eigenfaces for recognition.". Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 3 (1991), 71–86.
  * Fisherfaces as described in: Belhumeur, P. N., Hespanha, J., and Kriegman, D. "Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition using class specific linear projection.". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 19, 7 (1997), 711–720.
  * Local Binary Patterns Histograms as described in: Ahonen, T., Hadid, A., and Pietikainen, M. "Face Recognition with Local Binary Patterns.". Computer Vision - ECCV 2004 (2004), 469–481.

The library was written for OpenCV 2.3.1 with the upcoming OpenCV 2.4 in mind, so I don't support OpenCV versions earlier than 2.3.1. This project comes as a CMake project with a well-documented API and complete examples:
