[[http://www.math.yale.edu/mandelbrot/|BenoÃ®t B. Mandelbrot]], best known for his work on fractal geometry, died two days ago. A fractal is a geometric shape "that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.", a property called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity|self-similarity]]. Such shapes can be observed in nature: clouds, snow flakes, trees or systems of blood vessels exhibit approximate fractal pattern. 

This is an evening hack to visualize the Mandelbrot set with a Perl script. Please visit [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set|Wikipedia: Mandelbrot_set]] or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal|Wikipedia: Fractals]] for much cooler images.
