# Website Update #

[http://bytefish.de](http://bytefish.de) has been built on [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org) for years and I absolutely loved it. But I don't have the time to keep the installation in sync with latest security fixes and more recently some of the plugins began to act strange. It's finally time to make a change, so these pages are now built by [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), which is a static website generator. [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) is used for the comments, but I can't import comments from the old system - I am sorry.

Most of my private work is open source, so are the sources and content of this page:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de](https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de)

The theme is fit to my needs and contains some hardcoded stuff, so it is probably not useful for you without putting some work into. Most of the existing blog posts and wiki pages have been converted and should be available under the same URLs. I have omitted a few articles, that are not relevant anymore and I had to change some URLs in the wiki pages. Therefore some of the wiki pages have been turned into articles, early drafts will be added to [/pages](/pages) in the future. You can get a list of tags for the articles at [/tags](/tags), see I am not a huge fan of tag clouds so I have simply ordered the list by the number of articles. 

I'll probably extend some functionality, but right now I am quite happy. If you find something is missing in here, please do not hesitate to send me a mail!
