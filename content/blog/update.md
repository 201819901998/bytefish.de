# Website Update #

[http://bytefish.de](http://bytefish.de) has been built on [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org) for years and I absolutely loved it. But I don't have the time to keep the installation in sync with latest security fixes and more recently some of the plugins began to act strange. It's finally time to make a change, so these pages are now built by [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), which is a static website generator. [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) is used for the comments, but I can't import comments from the old system - I am sorry.

Most of my private work is open source, so are the sources and content of this page:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de](https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de)

All of the existing blog posts and wiki pages have been converted and should be available under the same URLs. Some of the wiki pages have been turned into articles, early drafts have been added to [/pages](/pages). A list of tags for the articles is available at [/tags](/tags), see I am not a huge fan of tag clouds. If you find something is missing in here, please do not hesitate to send me a mail.
