You always wanted to track the time you spend on your tasks? You've already got the strength to organize yourself into discrete units, but you are unable to find a tool for tracking your time?

[Robert](http://www.kakaomilchkuh.de) has created a nice little tool called [pymetracker](https://www.kakaomilchkuh.de/pymetracker) to eliminate your problems. Adding, timing and switching between tasks is intuitive. [pymetracker](https://www.kakaomilchkuh.de/pymetracker) comes with a nice user interface and a traybar icon (because everybody loves tray icons, at least I do).
