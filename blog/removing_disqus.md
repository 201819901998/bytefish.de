summary: Removing Disqus and using GitHub for discussions on articles.

Disqus started to show advertisments and it cannot be disabled, so I decided to remove Disqus.

Every page now contains a "How To Contribute" section, which explains how to ask questions or give feedback on articles. This 
is possible, because this page is a GitHub repository at:

* https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de

The GitHub Issues page, should be used for general discussions and feedback on articles. If there is something 
wrong or missing in the articles you can always make Pull Request to the page, and I will see if it can be 
merged into the article. I will find a way to make mentions in the articles.
