summary: Removing Disqus and using GitHub for discussions on articles.

Disqus lately started to show advertisements and the ads can no longer be disabled. I have no control about the ads 
it shows and I don't want any of my visitors to be bothered with ads. So I decided to remove Disqus.

Every page now contains a "How To Contribute" section, which explains how to ask questions or give feedback on articles. 

This is possible, because this page is a GitHub repository at:

* <a href="https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de">https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de</a>

You can use the GitHub Issue page for general discussions and feedback on articles. At the moment I have no intentions 
to automate the process or automatically include the discussions here. If it turns out to be too messy, I will start 
implementing a solution.
